At present, this essential role is not supported by validated curricula which produce individuals with the competencies, skills and capabilities the research community desperately needs to manage data.
In this report, the EOSC Association Task Force “Data stewardship, curricula and career paths” identifies how data stewardship is operationalised and implemented in the “real world”. Using implementation cases as the foundation for our recommendations, we move beyond literature and landscaping studies and build on practical experiences, including potentials, challenges and barriers to data stewardship.
Three priority areas form the major themes of this report, which are exemplified on European, national, and institutional levels are the following:
●      Skills, roles, and competencies: How to develop a competency profile for core data stewardship activities and define training levels needed by the different data steward roles in and outside the EOSC ecosystem.
●      Context: models and landscape: The role(s) of data stewards, their core activities, possible specialisations, or extension activities are defined in the context in which these roles operate.
●      Training and curricula: Produce guidelines for data stewardship curricula, which could include university curricula and short training, but ultimately as a sustainable training structure that can live on after the work of the task forces has been completed.
The report includes 17 Recommendations for European and national policymakers, funders and governments and 13 Recommendations for Research Performing Organizations on competencies training and curricula for data stewards; curricula and training for researchers, funders and decision makers; career paths; policies, data stewardship communities and networks.  
Whilst this report recommends approaches to curriculum and profile development, there are still barriers and leverage opportunities to overcome at the local level of implementation. Therefore, our recommendations are directed at decision-makers at the managerial and administrative levels, who can consult, coordinate and nudge recommendations into action.",report,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10573892,publication,open,zenodo,['10573891'],['eosc'],,"['Data Stewardship', 'Skills', 'Training', 'Curricula', 'Europe', 'EOSC', 'European Open Science Cloud', 'Competencies', 'Recommendations', 'Policymakers', 'Funders', 'Governments', 'Research Performing Organizations']",zenodo,,,7.13 Rapporto tecnico,recommendations for data stewardship skills training and curricula with implementation examples from european countries and universities,multiple ids

Classification of web-based Digital Humanities projects leveraging information visualisation techniques,14192758.0,10.5281/zenodo.14192758,"['Battisti, Tommaso']",['0009-0002-7980-3334'],2024-11-20,"Description
This dataset contains a list of 186 Digital Humanities projects leveraging information visualisation methods. Each project has been classified according to visualisation and interaction techniques, narrativity and narrative solutions, domain, methods for the representation of uncertainty and interpretation, and the employment of critical and custom approaches to visually represent humanities data.
 
Classification schema: categories and columns
The project_id column contains unique internal identifiers assigned to each project. Meanwhile, the last_access column records the most recent date (in DD/MM/YYYY format) on which each project was reviewed based on the web address specified in the url column.The remaining columns can be grouped into descriptive categories aimed at characterising projects according to different aspects:
 
Narrativity. It reports the presence of narratives employing information visualisation techniques. Here, the term narrative encompasses both author-driven linear data stories and more user-directed experiences where the narrative sequence is composed of user exploration [1]. We define 2 columns to identify projects using visualisation techniques in narrative, or non-narrative sections. Both conditions can be true for projects employing visualisations in both contexts. Columns:


non_narrative (boolean)


narrative (boolean)


 
Domain. The humanities domain to which the project is related. We rely on [2] and the chapters of the first part of [3] to abstract a set of general domains. Column:


domain (categorical):



History and archaeology


Art and art history


Language and literature


Music and musicology


Multimedia and performing arts


Philosophy and religion


Other: both extra-list domains and cases of collections without a unique or specific thematic focus.



 
Visualisation of uncertainty and interpretation. Buiding upon the frameworks proposed by [4] and [5], a set of categories was identified, highlighting a distinction between precise and impressional communication of uncertainty. Precise methods explicitly represent quantifiable uncertainty such as missing, unknown, or uncertain data, precisely locating and categorising it using visual variables and positioning. Two sub-categories are interactive distinction, when uncertain data is not visually distinguishable from the rest of the data but can be dynamically isolated or included/excluded categorically through interaction techniques (usually filters); and visual distinction, when uncertainty visually “emerges” from the representation by means of dedicated glyphs and spatial or visual cues and variables. On the other hand, impressional methods communicate the constructed and situated nature of data [6], exposing the interpretative layer of the visualisation and indicating more abstract and unquantifiable uncertainty using graphical aids or interpretative metrics. Two sub-categories are: ambiguation, when the use of graphical expedients—like permeable glyph boundaries or broken lines—visually convey the ambiguity of a phenomenon; and interpretative metrics, when expressive, non-scientific, or non-punctual metrics are used to build a visualisation. Column:


uncertainty_interpretation (categorical):



Interactive distinction


Visual distinction


Ambiguation


Interpretative metrics



 
Critical adaptation. We identify projects in which, for what concerns at least a visualisation, the following criteria are fulfilled: 1) avoid uncritical repurposing of prepackaged, generic-use, or ready-made solutions; 2) being tailored and unique to reflect the peculiarities of the phenomena at hand; 3) avoid extreme simplifications to embraces and depict complexity promoting time-spending visualisation-based inquiry. Column:


critical_adaptation (boolean)


 
Non-temporal visualisation techniques. We adopt and partially adapt the terminology and definitions from [7]. A column is defined for each type of visualisation and accounts for its presence within a project, also including stacked layouts and more complex variations. Columns and inclusion criteria:


plot (boolean): visual representations that map data points onto a two-dimensional coordinate system.


cluster_or_set (bool): sets or cluster-based visualisations used to unveil possible inter-object similarities.


map (boolean): geographical maps used to show spatial insights. While we do not specify the variants of maps (e.g., pin maps, dot density maps, flow maps, etc.), we make an exception for maps where each data point is represented by another visualisation (e.g., a map where each data point is a pie chart) by accounting for the presence of both in their respective columns.


network (boolean): visual representations highlighting relational aspects through nodes connected by links or edges.


hierarchical_diagram (boolean): tree-like structures such as tree diagrams, radial trees, but also dendrograms. They differ from networks for their strictly hierarchical structure and absence of closed connection loops.


treemap (boolean): still hierarchical, but highlighting quantities expressed by means of area size. It also includes circle packing variants.


word_cloud (boolean): clouds of words, where each instance’s size is proportional to its frequency in a related context


bars (boolean): includes bar charts, histograms, and variants. It coincides with “bar charts” in [7] but with a more generic term to refer to all bar-based visualisations.


line_chart (boolean): the display of information as sequential data points connected by straight-line segments.


area_chart (boolean): similar to a line chart but with a filled area below the segments. It also includes density plots.


pie_chart (boolean): circular graphs divided into slices which can also use multi-level solutions.


plot_3d (boolean): plots that use a third dimension to encode an additional variable.


proportional_area (boolean): representations used to compare values through area size. Typically, using circle- or square-like shapes.


other (boolean): it includes all other types of non-temporal visualisations that do not fall into the aforementioned categories.


 
Temporal visualisations and encodings. In addition to non-temporal visualisations, a group of techniques to encode temporality is considered in order to enable comparisons with [7]. Columns:


timeline (boolean): the display of a list of data points or spans in chronological order. They include timelines working either with a scale or simply displaying events in sequence. As in [7], we also include structured solutions resembling Gantt chart layouts.




temporal_dimension (boolean): to report when time is mapped to any dimension of a visualisation, with the exclusion of timelines. We use the term “dimension” and not “axis” as in [7] as more appropriate for radial layouts or more complex representational choices.


animation (boolean): temporality is perceived through an animation changing the visualisation according to time flow.


visual_variable (boolean): another visual encoding strategy is used to represent any temporality-related variable (e.g., colour).


 
Interaction techniques. A set of categories to assess affordable interaction techniques based on the concept of user intent [8] and user-allowed data actions [9]. The following categories roughly match the “processing”, “mapping”, and “presentation” actions from [9] and the manipulative subset of methods of the “how” an interaction is performed in the conception of [10]. Only interactions that affect the visual representation or the aspect of data points, symbols, and glyphs are taken into consideration. Columns:


basic_selection (boolean): the demarcation of an element either for the duration of the interaction or more permanently until the occurrence of another selection.


advanced_selection (boolean): the demarcation involves both the selected element and connected elements within the visualisation or leads to brush and link effects across views. Basic selection is tacitly implied.


navigation (boolean): interactions that allow moving, zooming, panning, rotating, and scrolling the view but only when applied to the visualisation and not to the web page. It also includes “drill” interactions (to navigate through different levels or portions of data detail, often generating a new view that replaces or accompanies the original) and “expand” interactions generating new perspectives on data by expanding and collapsing nodes.


arrangement (boolean): methods to organise visualisation elements (symbols, glyphs, etc.) or multi-visualisation layouts spatially through drag and drop or according to a criterion via more automatic triggers.


change (boolean): visual encoding alterations involving different aspects of visualisation as a whole: the same content is presented with another visualisation technique; the change involves symbols or glyphs aspect (colour, size, shape, etc.); the visualisation type is unaltered, but the layout variant changes (e.g., to stacked layouts); or other changes like axes inversion and scale modifications. The presence of all the visualisation techniques involved in a change is reported.


visualisation_filter (boolean): filters to exclude or include visualisation elements with respect to defined criteria, without reloading or generating a new visualisation. Unlike options triggering the fetch of new data to alter the visualisation content, filters seamlessly operate on existing visual elements.


collection_filter (boolean): the interaction with visualised elements acts as a filter for a related collection or list of items (e.g., clicking a region on a map filters a list of items according to spatial metadata).


aggregation (boolean): changes to the granularity of visual elements according to a variable. It produces either visual data summarisations or segregations.


btfw_interaction (boolean): to identify the use of “breaking the fourth wall interactions” as defined [11]. It applies only to narratives.


 
Narrative flow factors. Other categories aim to identify patterns in the design of narrative solutions. It is worth noticing that a project with multiple and diverse narratives can potentially report multiple design choices for the same column. Part of the factors and definitions from [12] are here re-used and adapted.
Story layout columns define the layout, or genre, of the narrative format:


document_layout (boolean)


slideshow_layout (boolean)


hybrid_layout (boolean): mixing document and slideshow layouts.


other_layout (boolean): more complex solutions.


Role of visualisation columns describe the role visualisations detain with respect to the entire story, in particular, with reference to the textual part of the narratives:

equal_role (boolean): visualisations and text play an equal role in the narrative.
figure_role (boolean): visualisations are supporting elements compared to the role of text.
annotated_role (boolean): visualisations are the drivers of the narrative.

Story progression columns categorise the shape of possible story paths:


linear_progression (categorical): strongly author-driven or user-directed narrative. Possible values specify the potential to skip certain parts while not having a fully explorative experience:



Skip


No-skip



user_directed (bool): users can select a path among multiple alternatives and compose narrative pieces, providing a broder degree of interaction and exploration possibilities [1]. If a linear path can be suggested, here it remains merely one option among many others. Differently from a linear-skip approach, it has a low level of guidance oriented towards linear navigation.


Navigation input columns define the ways users can move through the narrative:


button_input (boolean)


scroll_input (boolean)


slider_input (boolean)


Navigation progress columns describe methods through which the reader perceives its placement within the narrative:


text_progression (boolean): text or numbers act as signifiers for user position.


dots_progression (boolean)


visualisation_progression (boolean): the visualisation used in the narrative, or a visualised progress widget acts as a signifier for user position.


Level of control columns describe how much control a reader has over the text, visualisations, and animated transitions. Control could be discrete (D) when it triggers the motion, continuous (C) when it can act throughout all the keyframes, or hybrid (H) if it supports aspects of both. When animation is absent, control can be not available (NA). In particular, while visualisation control is related to the visualisation as a whole (e.g., the entire scatter plot moving up or down the page), the animated transition is related to more specific, data-relevant motion.Columns:


text_control (categorical):



D


C


H



visualisation_control (categorical):



D


C


H



animation_control (categorical):



D


C

NA

Our interest is in the role helping to shape purposeful and traceable communication in materials and manufacturing industries and, thus, to make knowledge become managed knowledge that is actionable for innovation. We envisage that such communication will lead to harmonisation across the boundaries of the wide range individual domains and disciplines interacting in these fields. Current divisions and silos mean that there is a huge untapped value not just in terms of ‘lost’ data but also stakeholder knowledge, which currently is not well captured. The Knowledge Management Translator will work with materials and manufacturing domain experts as well as data scientists and knowledge engineers to shape data in order to express knowledge. The job of the Knowledge Management Translator is to bring together and orchestrate people, tools, and processes to achieve this.
To define this new role, we build on existing Technology Translator roles such as the Materials Modelling Translator and the Analytics Translator. We also tap into the professional experience of all the authors who are actively researching, practising, or working with ontologies, materials modelling, and data sciences. Therefrom we create an ideal persona and assign a variety of tasks and required skills to them.
We provide a template for a structured approach to Knowledge Management Translation, as a process broken down into six steps, adapted from the Materials Modelling Translation Guide.
Given the wide range of tasks and skills required, hardly any person today will be able to fulfil all of these on their own. Hence, Translators will work in teams, also including some client-internal and third-party consultants. This sounds prohibitively expensive but may become reality once the clients create more and more data management roles, and once universities train data management skills, and once management of data related to materials and manufacturing will facilitate systematic sustainability assessment. Having the economic viability in mind, we suggest some early paths to success that do not require the full range of experts. We also highlight that clients need to have a certain maturity level regarding data readiness to enable a fruitful interaction, and with increasing data and knowledge management maturity clients will profit from implementing the role in their company.
We discuss some current gaps and challenges for this new role and outline the next steps to make the Knowledge Management Translator role a reality. We aim to consolidate expert knowledge and further develop the role in the context of the H2020 OntoCommons project, to offer budding Knowledge Management Translators continuous professional development opportunities.",report,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7041697,publication,open,zenodo,['7041696'],"['ontocommons', 'eu']",,"['Knowledge Management Translator', 'Semantics', 'Ontologies', 'Materials Science', 'Manufacturing', 'Industry 5.0', 'Industry Commons']",zenodo,,,7.13 Rapporto tecnico,the translator in knowledge management for innovation – towards industry commons,multiple ids

This dataset is a subset of 25 selected species from the Reef Check Med - key Mediterranean marine species dataset, and it is specifically intended to calculate the MedSens index developed by Eva Turicchia, Carlo Cerrano, Matteo Ghetta, Marco Abbiati and Massimo Ponti (Turicchia et al., 2021). MedSens data is provided as ESRI shapefiles in WGS84 geographic coordinates (EPSG:4326).
 
MedSens abstract
Citizen science (CS) projects may provide community-based ecosystem monitoring, expanding our ability to collect data across space and time. However, the data from CS are often not effectively integrated into institutional monitoring programs and decision-making processes, especially in marine conservation. This limitation is partially due to difficulties in accessing the data and the lack of tools and indices for proper management at intended spatial and temporal scales. MedSens is a biotic index specifically developed to provide information on the environmental status of subtidal rocky coastal habitats, filling a gap between marine CS and coastal management in the Mediterranean Sea. The MedSens index is based on 25 selected species, incorporating their sensitivities to the pressures indicated by the European Union’s Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSDF) and open data on their distributions and abundances, collected by trained volunteers (mainly scuba divers, but also free divers and snorkelers) using the Reef Check Mediterranean Underwater Coastal Environment Monitoring (RCMed U-CEM) protocol. The species sensitivities were assessed relative to their resistance and resilience against physical, chemical, and biological pressures, according to benchmark levels and a literature review. The MedSens index was calibrated on a dataset of 33,021 observations from 569 volunteers (2001 to 2019), along six countries’ coasts. A free and user-friendly QGIS plugin allows easy index calculation for areas and time frames of interest. The MedSens index was applied to Mediterranean marine protected areas (MPAs) and the management and monitoring zones within Italian MPAs. In the studied cases, the MedSens index responds well to the local pressures documented by previous investigations.
MedSens converts the data collected by trained volunteers into an effective monitoring tool for the Mediterranean subtidal rocky coastal habitats. MedSens can help conservationists and decision-makers identify the main pressures acting in these habitats, as required by the MSFD, supporting them in the implementation of appropriate marine biodiversity conservation measures and better communicate the results of their actions. By directly involving stakeholders, this approach increases public awareness and the acceptability of management decisions, enabling more participatory conservation tactics.

By addressing two main research questions, the paper proposes a workflow that involves the systematic acquisition, processing, and digitisation of cultural heritage artefacts. In particular, the workflow focuses on developing digital twins for cultural heritage settings and exhibitions and proposes baseline standards for both technical and interpretative aspects of digitisation. The workflow has been derived and tested on the pilot case of the temporary exhibition Other Renaissance: Ulisse Aldrovandi and the Wonders of the World in the context of the CHANGES project. We reflect on the software and hardware equipment, the procedures and techniques to use, and the formats to adopt to comply with openness, accessibility, transparency, reproducibility, reusability and sustainability of the research workflow by backing on previous works on fostering reproducibility in research and improving the interoperability of 3D data across different systems. It highlights the necessity for transparent documentation of every step of the process, focusing on accountability and practices in the context of cultural heritage research. Finally, the deliverable also suggests improvements to enhance the sustainability of these workflows and discusses future directions for digitisation efforts and sharing research practices.

It estimates how much the predisposing factors affect past phenomena in order to predict future scenarios.
Numerous tools and software are available for susceptibility analysis. Some of them are focused on spatial susceptibility or susceptibility zoning and are developed on both proprietary and open-source Geographical Information Systems, such as: GRASS r.landslide (Bragagnolo et al., 2020), ArcGIS ArcSDM (Kemp et al. 2002) and Toolboxes (Jebur et al., 2015), R LAND-SE (Rossi & Reichenbach, 2016), R RSAGA (Brenning et al., 2018).
In this work, a new open-source tool for susceptibility zoning has been implemented for the QGIS software, named Susceptibility Zoning plugin (SZ-plugin). It allows to map the susceptibility of a specific object of study in the selected area. In particular, the plugin has been developed for landslide susceptibility mapping in the context of the project Silk Road Disaster Risk Reduction of the Belt and Road Initiative (Lei et al., 2018) to prevent and mitigate the risk induced by landslides on the infrastructure.
The code has been written in Python3 using third-party libraries and plugins such us: scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011), NumPy, Matplotlib (Caswell et al., 2020 ; Hunter, 2007), GDAL, QGIS Plugin Builder, Plotly and Pandas.
The plugin version 1.0 maps the susceptibility through severalstatistical methods: Weight of Evidence, Frequency Ratio, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest. The analysis provides a measure of the probability of occurrence expressed by the Susceptibility Index (SI). Moreover, the SZ-plugin allows to evaluate the prediction capacity of the model by the representation of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves based on the training and validating datasets respectively and to cross-validate the result by simple random selection or k-fold method.
The result is an efficient tool which supports the susceptibility zoning from the spatial analysis to the validation of the method and results.

This resulted in the creation of the KNOT Taxonomy and KNOT Technology Thesaurus, two SKOS-based controlled vocabularies. 
The KNOT Taxonomy aims to provide a simple hierarchical classification and definitions for different types of scholarly digital objects produced by humanities research, such as software, databases, digital platforms, and datasets. In the context of this taxonomy scholarly digital objects are understood as being either collections of structured information (such as datasets) or digital forms that enable interaction with information (software, visualization tools, etc.). 
The KNOT Technology Thesaurus aims to provide a hierarchical classification and definitions for a variety of technological concepts related to the research projects and scholarly digital objects catalogued by the KNOT project, such as the formal languages and information architecture used. 
Both vocabularies are used in the KNOT Catalogue (see https://zenodo.org/records/15037686), and intended to help increase the visibility of the scholarly digital objects created by humanities research. Definitions are taken from trusted sources and intended to act as a starting point for the classification of these objects within existing research structures and to improve authority control for the technologies used in humanities research.
The vocabularies are made available in traditional SKOS format and in SKOS with additional DCAT information, similarly to the vocabularies available from Schema, the Italian national catalogue of semantic data. The DCAT versions are labelled as such in the file name. 
Development of the vocabularies is ongoing. At the time of publication of this Zenodo record, the vocabularies are at version 1.3. All versions, as well as additional information about the vocabularies can be found on GitHub. The vocabularies can also be accessed and queried via the /DH.ARC Skosmos repository.

The mouth of the Bevano river is a transition area that boasts great naturalistic and environmental value. The stream, which originates 180 m above sea level, presents one of the last examples of a meandering estuary in the North Adriatic. Located in the province of Ravenna, it is among the best protected transition areas in the Emilia-Romagna region. This is a Site of Community Importance (SCI), Special Protection Area (SPA), Ramsar Zone and Wildlife Protection Oasis. The site is also included among the State Reserves (""Duna costiera ravennate e foce torrente Bevano"") and is part of the Po Delta Regional Park (""Pineta di Classe e Saline di Cervia"" station).
The mouth of the Bevano river, protected from human disturbance and in particular from that linked to tourism, has been left free to evolve in the coastal system for years. However, in 2006, some manipulative interventions on the morphology of the mouth were necessary and unpostponable to guarantee the conservation of the surrounding habitats. In the thirty years prior to the works, in fact, the mouth of the Bevano torrent had gradually undergone a shift towards the north for reasons linked in part to the phenomenon of subsidence which strongly affects the entire region, and in part to the predominance of long-coast currents and the low-energy river regime. The effects of the migration of the mouth northwards were: a rapid erosion of the pine forest behind and of the dunes north of the mouth and a serious difficulty in disposing of the water towards the sea in periods of river floods with consequent flooding of the surrounding agricultural lands. Thanks to the works carried out in 2006, the original mouth of the river was closed and a new one was dug 600 meters south. Furthermore, the dune was rebuilt to protect the pine forest behind it and a drainage channel was built to guarantee the entry of sea water during the high tides and the exit of the water from the stream during floods.
Here, sampling of the benthic fauna present on the seabed in July 2020 allowed the identification of 86 taxa. The most abundant species were the Lentidium mediterraneum bivalves (on average 3676 ind. m-2) and the Prionospio caspersi polychaete (3368 ind. m-2). Also the Chamelea gallina clam, a bivalve of great commercial interest, was found to be very abundant (559 ind. m-2).

Due to the serious problem of coastal erosion, various coastal protection techniques have been tested over time at this site, in the Riccione municipality, and various nourishment activities have been carried out. To date, the site has two types of anti-erosion structures: a sandbag barrier and two artificial concrete structures called WMesh.
A first sandbag barrier was built during a project dating back to 1983 which involved several locations along the Emilia-Romagna coast. The construction of this barrier, which followed a pioneering ""first generation"" design, involved the use of sandbags 1 meter high located parallel to the coast and at a depth of approximately 3 m. However, over time, this barrier proved to be not very resistant to the force of the waves and the activity of the mussels, resulting in movement and breakage of the bags. Thirteen years after its construction, in fact, the problem of coastal erosion once again became very evident along the coasts of Riccione. Therefore, in 1995 a second barrier was built (called ""second generation""), similar to the first but with the addition of some improvements. This was built higher and closer to the shore line (at a distance of approximately 200 m), using larger sandbags. Furthermore, to increase its anti-erosive effectiveness, bags were added positioned perpendicular to the barrier in order to limit the transport, and therefore the loss, of the sediment due to the currents.
Here, sampling of the benthic fauna present on the seabed in June 2020 allowed the identification of 60 taxa. The most abundant species was the tanaid crustacean Apseudopsis mediterraneus (on average 5586 ind. m-2). Lentidium mediterraneum bivalves were also very abundant (958 ind. m-2). Also the Chamelea gallina clam, a bivalve of great commercial interest, was found to be quite abundant (389 ind. m-2).

Lido di Dante is a small seaside village in the North Adriatic, 7 km from the city of Ravenna, in the area delimited by the mouths of the rivers Fiumi Uniti to the north and Bevano to the south. The two drainage basins of the rivers have very different dimensions and characteristics: the Fiumi Uniti basin is much larger and contains an important mountainous part which contributes a notable quantity of sediments, while the Bevano river is essentially a natural drainage channel of the plain with negligible sediment transport.
The sandy beach of Lido di Dante has a concave shape and is more than 2.5 km long, it can be divided into two parts: the north beach, almost 600 m long, subject to strong erosion and therefore protected by groins, nourishment and a semi-submerged breakwater and the southern beach which has undergone only slight erosion and is in a natural state. It has a tidal range between 0.30 m and 0.85 m, a gentle slope of the seabed, a large surf zone exposed to winds blowing from the south-east in summer and from the north-east in winter and bottom sediments ranging from fine to medium well-sorted sand.
To date, the low transport rates of river sediments and anthropic and natural subsidence have caused the recession of the coastline; furthermore, dune erosion and land subsidence, together with the construction of tourist facilities, have altered and partially destroyed the marine pine forests behind the dunes and caused the balance of the beach to be disrupted. For this reason, the protection of the coast of Lido di Dante was of primary importance and supported by the application of several subsequent interventions aimed at stopping the retreat of the coastline which became relevant around 1960. In fact, the first works were carried out in 1978, when a single structure was built to retain the transport of sediments due to coastal drift. In 1983, two more groins were built south of the previous one and placed 300 m apart from each other. In 1996, the current limestone rock barrier was built parallel to the coast, 180 meters from the shoreline and with a length of 770 m and, at the same time, a nourishment of 74,400 m3 of sand was implemented. The authorities also carried out large-scale nourishment in May 2007 which affected both the beach within the protection works and the one immediately to the south, the area of our interest, using sediments from offshore deposits.
Here, sampling of the benthic fauna present on the seabed in October 2020 allowed the identification of 76 taxa. The most abundant species were the Lentidium mediterraneum bivalves (on average 4465 ind. m-2). The Chamelea gallina clam, a bivalve of great commercial interest, was less abundant compared to other coastal areas in the region (109 ind. m-2).

As a result, TWS is a crucial variable of the global hydrologic cycle, representing an essential indicator of water availability.
Since 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission and its follow-on (GRACE-FO) have been measuring temporal and spatial variations of TWS, namely the Terrrestrial Water Storage Anomalies (TWSA), enabling the monitoring of global hydrological changes over the last two decades. However, the lack of observations prior to 2002 along with the temporal gaps in GRACE/GRACE-FO time series limit our understanding of long-term variations of global freshwater availability.
In this study, we use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) neural networks and two sets of predictors to develop four global monthly reconstructions of TWSA from 1984 to 2021 at 0.5º spatial resolution (GRAiCE). The first set of predictors is given by a combination of five fundamental meteorological forcings and data on vegetation dynamics, whereas the second set of predictors includes the five meteorological forcings only. Specifically, the meteorological predictors are monthly averaged data of total precipitation, snow depth water equivalent, surface net solar radiation, surface air temperature, and surface air relative humidity. We derive data on vegetation dynamics from a long-term reconstruction of solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), which represents a proxy for photosynthesis. Each model is trained with monthly TWSA data from the GRACE JPL mascon dataset. The GRAiCE dataset accurately reproduces GRACE/GRACE-FO observations at the global scale and across different climatic regions. Moreover, we found that our models predict observed TWSA better than a previous reference reconstruction and produce reliable estimates of the water budget at the river basin scale. Beyond generating long-term continuous TWSA time series, our models allow us to detect and examine TWS changes due to climate variability/change.
This repository contains the GRAiCE dataset and includes four files in netCDF format. The dataset provides monthly TWSA estimates from 1984 to 2021 at a 0.5º spatial resolution. TWSA values are expressed in terms of cm of equivalent water thickness.

F-DATA is composed of 38 files, with each YY_MM.parquet file containing the data of the jobs submitted in the month MM of the year YY. 

The files of F-DATA are saved as .parquet files. It is possible to load such files as dataframes by leveraging the pandas APIs, after installing pyarrow (pip install pyarrow). A single file can be read with the following Python instrcutions:


# Importing pandas library
import pandas as pd
 
# Read the 21_01.parquet file in a dataframe format
df = pd.read_parquet(""21_01.parquet"")
df.head()

The study examines three main approaches: ranked statements, null-valued objects, and qualified statements with properties P5102 (reason of statement), P1480 (sourcing circumstances) and P2241 (reason for deprecated rank) by analysing their prevalence, success, and clarity in Wikidata. The analysis is performed over cultural heritage artefacts stored in Wikidata divided in three subsets (i.e. visual heritage, textual heritage and audio-visual heritage) and compared with astronomical data (stars and galaxies entities from Wikidata) and a Random dataset (entities chosen randomly from the most used 100 classes). The findings indicate that (1) the representation of weaker logical status information is limited, with only a small proportion of items reporting such information, (2) the representation of WLS varies significantly between the two datasets. Finally, we propose several representation alternatives to simplify and standardize the representation of this type of information in Wikidata, with the hope of increasing its accuracy and richness",dataset,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10044574,dataset,open,zenodo,['7624783'],['wiki4r'],,"['wikidata', 'weaker logical status', 'knowledge representation', 'ranked statements', 'uncertainty', 'cultural heritage']",zenodo,,,7.05 Banche dati,wikidata selection of cultural heritage stars galaxies and random entities and claims,multiple ids

The forward model σ-IASI has been initially developed in the framework of a long collaboration between UniBas (formerly DIFA (Department of Environmental Engineering and Physics of the University of Basilicata) and EUMETSAT to assist the various developing phases of IASI. The code uses a look-up table for the optical depth. The look-up table is derived from the LBLRTM (Line-by-Line Radiative Transfer Model) model (e.g., the latest version of σ-IASI uses LBLRTM version 12.2). The forward module is based on 60 pressure layers, spanning the atmosphere from the ground level to the top level assumed to be at 0.005 hPa. The model computes spectral radiances and analytical Jacobian derivatives of any surface (ground or thick cloud if needed) and/or atmospheric parameter. IASI radiances are obtained through convolution with the IASI Instrumental Spectral Response Function (ISRF). LBLRTM and σ-IASI share the same spectral line library. This is the Atmospheric Environmental Research or AER v_3.2 line parameter database with the continuum absorption MT_CKD 2.5.2 (e.g. see http://rtweb.aer.com/lblrtm_frame.html). The AER line database adopts HITRAN2008 with exceptions for H2O, CO2, and O2. For what concerns the IASI spectral range, the H2O line positions and intensities for the wavenumber region from 10 to 2500 cm-1 are from [Coudert et al., 2008]; CO2 absorption optical depth calculations take advantage of the first order line coupling coefficients re-calculated using the formalism of [Niro et al., 2005].
In the published version of σ-IASI, the atmospheric state vector is specified by surface temperature and emissivity, atmospheric profiles of temperature, plus mixing ratios profiles of H2O, HDO, O3, CO2, CO, CH4, N2O, HNO3, SO2, NH3, OCS, and CF4. Apart from these species whose concentration can be varied, hence retrieved, σ-IASI also considers a set of fixed species that are considered in the construction of the forward model. The set includes the major species N2 and O2, which are taken into account through their collision-induced continuum. In addition, σ-IASI can consider other trace gases, such as NO, NO2, OH, HCl, H2CO, HCN, CH3Cl, and C2H2. The reference vertical profiles of these molecules are fixed according to the US Standard atmosphere model [Anderson, 1986]. Fixed gases include also heavy molecules whose radiative effect is modeled through cross-sections. They are CCl4, CFC-11, CFC-12 and HCFC-22. For these heavy molecules, we use the original cross-sections from HITRAN2008, meaning that their spectral optical depth is not converted to the look-up table. As for other gases, their vertical mixing ratio is modeled according to [Anderson, 1986] and scaled for column abundance consistently with the most recent World Data Center for Greenhouse Gases report (WDCGG).
In its most recent version, new input species have been added explicitly to the state vector of σ-IASI. This could possibly be done also for the mixing ratio profiles HCl, H2S, C2H2, C2H4, and HCN. These species can thus be easily included in the retrieved state vector of the inverse scheme, δ-IASI [Carissimo et al. 2005].
Although initially developed for IASI, σ-IASI is presently a generic radiative transfer model, which is well suited for nadir viewing satellite and aircraft infrared sensors with spectral sampling intervals in the range of 0.1-2 cm-1. It covers the spectral range between 5 and 2760 cm-1 [Serio et al. 2008].
The software was developed in Fortran and tested to run on Linux platforms and MS Windows. In its latest version [Liuzzi et al., 2017] the model can deal with clouds and aerosol. Clouds and aerosols are specified with their own profile and transmittance calculations are performed at the level of the single layers, the same as for gas species. Multiple scattering of clouds and particles is dealt with by a scaling scheme following [Chou et al., 1999], where particle scattering contribution is accounted for by replacing the optical depth with an apparent optical depth for extinction.
Recently, thanks to a collaboration with UniBO (Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Bologna) supported by a program of the Italian Space Agency, a new and accurate parametrization [Martinazzo et al. 2021] dealt with clouds and aerosol optical parameters as a function of their a) concentration; b) effective radii. Thanks to this original parameterization, the current version of σ-IASI is the only fast-forward model capable of computing analytical Jacobian derivatives with respect to ice and water content concentrations and respect to the effective radius. Thus, the new σ-IASI model yields for retrieving cloud microphysical properties.

Data were obtained through benthic community field surveys conducted by 33 research teams from 11 Mediterranean countries. Surveys covered thousands of kms of coastline, spanning 13º of latitude (32 °S to 45 °N) and 40º of longitude (-5°W to 35°E) in the Mediterranean Sea. The dataset provides the most updated inventory of mass mortality events records for benthic species between 2015-2019 in the region. The surveys were conducted in 142 monitoring areas. Monitoring areas were considered as geographic areas (10-25 km coastline, e.g., a marine protected area and the nearby coast) sharing common environmental features.

Please note: the log file contains commands referred to the use of SpaceMix (Bradburd GS, Ralph PL, Coop GM, 2013. Disentangling the effects of geographic and ecological isolation on genetic differentiation. Evolution 67(11):3258-3273)
In order to run SpaceMix as reported in the main text it is necessary to follow the instructions reported in the relative log section (SPACEMIX). Data files to be used for SPACEMIX can be downloaded from the linked dataset provided by Estonian Biocentre (www.ebc.ee/free_data) and adapted from Pagani et al. 2016 (doi:10.1038/nature19792)

In order to run all the remaining analyses in R using the source file through direct copy-and-paste of the commands reported in the log, it is necessary to comment out the relevant SPACEMIX section from the log file itself (beginning and end of the section are appropriately signalled)
Please also note that all the raw data files with a "".csv"" extension are grouped into a folder named ""data"" in order to be used jointly with source codes and commands as they are now.",software,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.821360,software,open,zenodo,['821359'],[],,,zenodo,,,7.04 Software,bortolinietal2017inferring patterns of folktale diffusion using genomic datacodesanddata,doi

Specifically, ECFAS provides a much-needed solution to bolster coastal resilience to climate risk and reduce population and infrastructure exposure by monitoring and supporting disaster preparedness, two factors that are fundamental to damage prevention and recovery if a storm hits.
The ECFAS Proof-of-Concept development ran from January 2021 to December 2022. The ECFAS project was a collaboration between Scuola Universitaria Superiore IUSS di Pavia (Italy, ECFAS Coordinator), Mercator Ocean International (France), Planetek Hellas (Greece), Collecte Localisation Satellites (France), Consorzio Futuro in Ricerca (Italy), Universitat Politecnica de Valencia (Spain), University of the Aegean (Greece), and EurOcean (Portugal), and was funded by the European Commission H2020 Framework Programme within the call LC-SPACE-18-EO-2020 - Copernicus evolution: research activities in support of the evolution of the Copernicus services.

Description of the product
Deliverable 5.1 is a comprehensive inventory of extreme coastal events that produced flooding at different locations along the European coastline. It includes the collection and identification of events, locations and available information on the test cases.
The purpose of the ECFAS database is to provide a source of information on extreme coastal events and locations that experienced coastal flooding, considering both hazard and impact aspects. Thus, the database collects events, sites and available information to support further investigation on specific test cases. Test cases are defined here as specific sites where an extreme event that generated flooding and damage occurred. The time frame considered for the analysis is between 2010 and 2020 in order to use recent satellite imagery with good resolution and including, if possible, overlap with Sentinel missions.
The product includes three files: 1) an Excel file with the inventory; 2) an accompanying report that includes the guidelines to use the inventory, other relevant information on the method used to implement the inventory and the sources of information; 3) the test cases polygons in .geojson format.

In spite of the centrality that such institutions and actors play in all Europeans’ everyday life, as of today the European project remains fragile and subject to eroding pressures from factors such as macro-economic cycles and anti-EU political movements, among many others. It is important to advance our insights into how citizens’ knowledge of relevant aspects of everyday social, political, and economic life in the EU is shaped and how this impacts their identification with the European project and affects European integration more generally. 
We argue that citizens’ understandings of the EU as institution are socially constructed and that communicative and discursive processes play an essential role in these construction processes. Identification and integration essentially depend on such shared social meanings.
European studies increasingly recognize the importance of social constructivism and discourse as perspectives to better understand different aspects of European integration – a process through which new supra-national institutions and social identities emerge as well as existent local institutions and identities transform. Different from previous approaches, both social constructivism and a focus on discourse entail that institutions, as well as the identities of social actors, matter in a particular way. That is, they are not given or easy for any political elite to manipulate, rather they get shaped through ongoing social interactions with language playing a central role. Paying close attention to the complexities of integration as a transformative and discursive process seems to be a more promising approach than regarding integration as an exercise of ‘simple’ institutional design.
We argue that in spite of the increased importance of social constructivist and discourse approaches in social sciences during the last 30 years, their applications in EU studies, which are more recent, continue to constitute a rather ‘closed’ scholarly field. In order to increase the empirical relevance of social constructivism and discourse in EU studies and beyond, we offer three contributions. First, we review extant literature in this scholarly domain. In particular, we find that work that has fruitfully utilised a social constructivist perspective has somehow spanned three main areas: a) integration as Europeanization of legal systems and norms, b) integration as the Europeanization of discourses on polity ideas and public debates about EU governance, and c) integration as the Europeanization of citizens’ identities and definitions of what ‘Europe’ means. Second, in order to open up this literature to interdisciplinary research we highlight overlaps and parallels especially to institutional organization theory that shares with this literature the social constructivist perspective and has been fruitfully used to analyse questions of institutional change and identity formation. Third and finally, we extend the analytical tool box by highlighting methods that can be used to explore integration and identification from a social constructive and discursive perspective.",technical_report,https://amsacta.unibo.it/id/eprint/5517,monograph,,,,,,,amsacta,,,7.13 Rapporto tecnico,perceive project deliverable d51 short contribution report to be used in dissemination events about the empirical relevance of a social constructivist and discursive approach to eu identity emergence and integration,multiple ids

Policy. Practitioners in the feld of public policy communication in general and Cohesion Policy in
particular tend to agree on the need to increase the prominence and effectiveness of new media as
key channels of strategic communication of both central institutions and national/local managing
authorities.
Social media in particular tends to be associated with the possibility of reaching the youngest
population (see for example the results of our interviews and survey in PERCEIVE Deliverables 3.1 and
3.2). However, their potential impact on communication strategies goes much beyond this point and
encompasses changes in the segmentation of target audiences (i.e. communities rather than the
general public) on the one hand, and in the way Cohesion Policy ‘stories’ are told on the other hand
(i.e. interactivity with audiences).
In spite of the potential impact of new and especially social media on strategic policy
communication, based on our experience in the feld as well as on a review of both academic and
practice-oriented literature, we argue that much is still to be learnt about how to realise this
potential. This is especially true given the scarce attention of academic research to the specifcities of
Cohesion Policy, among other public policies.
Therefore, in order to extend current knowledge on the communication issues highlighted above, we

four levels of communication:
1) Communications of the EU: here we analyzed the magazine Panorama;
2) Local implementation: here we analyzed financed projects’ abstracts;
3) Local press: at this level we focus on newspapers;
4) Social media: at this level we focus on Facebook.
The analysis performed with Topic Modeling on the corpus of tweets collected from Twitter did not
provide good results, due to the short length of each tweet. It is a result that is expected, but
collected data are not useless. In order to provide a better coherence of this report, which focuses on
the results of Topic Modeling, we are therefore not providing an analysis of tweets here. On the
contrary, we will analyze tweet in the next deliverable 3.3, that is aimed at analyzing the use LMAs

for financed projects’ abstracts, 7 models for newspapers – one for each country – and 7 models for
Facebook. Regarding Facebook, LMAs in our case study region in UK do not have a Facebook profile.
The seventh model regards thus European Institutions’ Facebook profiles. Each model is composed
of a list of 20 topics, which we analyze and characterize through descriptive statististics. We focus in
particular on the emergent topics related to European Identity and Cohesion Policy. Moreover, in
this report, we make use of formal methods and techniques to visually represent the meaning of

Accordingly, extant research has explored the role of the media in shaping the opinions of the general public. However, only recently has research started focusing on the potential role of cohesion policy in shaping EU identity and many aspects of this phenomenon are still unexplored.
We claim that by extending knowledge in this still unfolding area our work contributes to the wider debate on European identity in several ways:
a) by performing a media analysis in seven different countries we offer one of the first international evidences as most of the media analyses are conducted in individual national contexts;
b) our study is based on a large ad-hoc designed survey which allows us to capture so far largely overlooked aspects of EU identity such as the multiplicity and synchronicity of levels – i.e. individual, regional and national – in a way that Eurobarometer-based research could not do so far;
c) our survey also allowed us to explore in unprecedented depth the factors associated with different definitions of being European;
d) we analyse media in a bottom-up way, that is, without using pre-coded frames of valence characterising most of extant research;
e) along with standard interpretive techniques, we use formal methods for representing national media spaces such as topic modelling and sentiment analysis.

Over the two last two decades, no clear pattern seems to have emerged linking the efforts of the
European Union (EU) to foster local development and reduction of disparities with a generalized
increase in the levels of European identity. This constitutes a relevant challenge for both policy
makers and local implementers as well as for students of the European integration process. In this
context, it is surprising how little attention has been paid to the potential role of cohesion policy –
the EU’s largest investment policy aimed at promoting regional development and reducing
disparities.
Based on a recognition of previous research and direct experience acquired through interaction
with practitioners of the cohesion policy field, in this report, we point out the importance of
‘awareness’ and ‘appreciation’ (of EU efforts) by EU citizens. This means that, albeit not a general
rule, those who are aware of the policy often appreciate EU developmental policies and, when these
two conditions are matched with each other, tend to fell more European. In managerial terms, this
gap between institutions and citizens points to the centrality of policy communication. That is, we
need to better understand the mechanisms and outcomes of communicating policy in todays’
practice of policy implementation.
Accordingly, this report aims at increasing our understanding of a number of strategic aspects
connected with the task of communicating EU regional cohesion policy at the local level. In more
detail, two main aspects are dealt with: First, the extent to which local communication activities
take part in a wider international discourse (i.e. through topics). Here, we expand our previous work
(i.e. see PERCEIVE deliverables 5.3 and 3.3) on communicating EU cohesion policy through social
media by analyzing contents generated by Local Managing Authorities’ (hereafter referred to as
LMAs) use of Facebook. And second, the impact and effectiveness of communication efforts (i.e. the
effect of the amount of communication investments and the content of communication activities
on citizens’ awareness of EU policies and appreciation of EU actions). Inquiring this aspect entailed a
statistical analysis of the association between communication efforts which LMAs disseminate the
aims and accomplishments of regional cohesion policy on the one hand, and awareness as well as
appreciation of the policy by EU citizens on the other hand. The outcomes of the social media
analysis described as the first aspect above are also included as variables of the statistical analysis of
the second focal aspect.",technical_report,https://amsacta.unibo.it/id/eprint/6111,monograph,,,,,,,amsacta,,,7.13 Rapporto tecnico,perceive project deliverable d34 report on the statistical analysis of communication efforts’ impact and effectiveness on citizens’ awareness and appreciation of eufinanced projects,multiple ids

Over the past decade, both the revision of taphonomic processes affecting archaeological faunal assemblages and new zooarchaeological studies have allowed archaeologists to better understand subsistence strategies and cultural behaviors attributed to groups of Neandertal and modern humans living in the region.

This work presents the preliminary results of a 5-year research programme (ERC n. 724046 – SUCCESS) and offers a state-of-the-art synthesis of archaeological faunal assemblages including mammals and birds uncovered in Italy between 50 and 35 ky ago. The present data were recovered in primary Late Mousterian, Uluzzian, and Protoaurignacian stratigraphic contexts from Northern Italy (Grotta di Fumane, Riparo del Broion, Grotta Maggiore di San Bernardino, Grotta del Rio Secco, Riparo Bombrini), and Southern Italy (Grotta di Castelcivita, Grotta della Cala, Grotta del Cavallo, and Riparo l'Oscurusciuto). The available Number of Identified Specimens (NISP) is analysed through intra- and inter-site comparisons at a regional scale, while aoristic analysis is applied to the sequence documented at Grotta di Fumane. Results of qualitative comparisons suggest an increase in the number of hunted taxa since the end of the Middle Palaeolithic, and a marked change in ecological settings beginning with the Protoaurignacian, with a shift to lower temperatures and humidity. The distribution of carnivore remains and taphonomic analyses hint at a possible change in faunal exploitation and butchering processing between the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic. A preliminary comparison between bone frequencies and the distribution of burned bones poses interesting questions concerning the management of fire. Eventually, the combined use of relative taxonomic abundance and aoristic analysis explicitly addresses time averaging and temporal uncertainty embedded in NISP counts and offers estimates of absolute change over time that can be used to support hypotheses emerging from taxon relative frequencies.",,https://amsacta.unibo.it/id/eprint/6209,dataset,,University of Bologna,,,,,amsacta,,,7.05 Banche dati,romandini et al codes and data for macromammal and bird assemblages across the late middle to upper palaeolithic transition in italy an extended zooarchaeological review,title

factor for children’s future success and development, while negative experiences can have lasting
challenges leading to poorer educational performance, especially for more disadvantaged children.
Adopting a more unified approach to caring and learning (educare) across educational settings in
order to sustain continuity of children’s experiences over time, can significantly improve children’s
educational achievement and socio-emotional development. In turn promoting inter-institutional
professional learning communities of ECEC and primary school staff as well as involving parents in
the transition process are considered to be key factors in ensuring successful transitions. Taking these crucial elements into account, practitioners and researchers from four different countries
have collaborated in a transnational action-research study (START/Erasmus +) in order to foster warm
and inclusive transitions across the early years. In line with the European Commission priorities, the general objectives of the project were:
• to ensure a good start in education for all children, by enhancing the quality of ECEC and by
ensuring that the benefits of ECEC are carried through to statutory school/ education levels;
• to support teachers and ECEC staff to adopt new methods and tools for dealing with complex
classroom realities and diversified groups of learners.
More specifically, four pilot projects in four different countries (Sl, It, UK, Be) were established to
develop warm and inclusive transitional practices with specific attention to children and families who
face complex family situations (e.g. socio-economic disadvantage) and are at ‘risk of social exclusion’
(e.g. Roma, children with migrant background, refugee children, children with special educational
needs). These innovative practices were enabled by setting up inter-institutional professional learning
communities of ECEC, primary school staff and/or other local stakeholders. By engaging in action

The model was already presented in the Deliverables 6.1 (qualitative model) and 6.2 (quantitative model). Focusing on the two subsystems under study, namely the funds’ absorption and general public awareness, the behavioural analysis includes both: (i) quantitative sensitivity analyses of the model’s parameters on the simulation results, (ii) and qualitative insights based on real data, the model’s structure and the outcomes of the quantitative analysis.
More specifically, we articulated this study in two parts according to the model’s subsystems. In the funds’ absorption subsystem, as a reminder of the problem under study, we first report a concise analysis of EU and regional evidence on absorption rates. Then, the absorption model is presented in brief, followed by an extensive sensitivity analyses of the model’s parameters. The analysis provides the major simulation findings, along with indicative policy recommendations. Finally, a comprehensive discussion of the modelling approach, based on real data and the modelling results, is presented. In the general awareness subsystem, initially the available awareness data of the related Eurobarometer’s reports are presented for the contextualization of the problem. Thereafter, the awareness model is briefly discussed, while the main sensitivity analyses results are presented along with the related recommendations. Lastly, the model’s building process and the quantitative outcomes are discussed.
Overall, this final Deliverable 6.3 contributes towards: (i) identifying the major factors of the CP system that affect the local managing authorities’ (LMAs’) performance in terms of funds’ absorption, as well as the citizens’ awareness about the EU role on regional development, (ii) in order to offer meaningful managerial insights for fostering the LMA administrative capacity and increasing the general public awareness about regional CP funding benefits. The analysis of the influencing factors, along with the adoption of efficient policies, is anticipated to improve the state of the CP system and support the regional sustainability of the local communities.",technical_report,https://amsacta.unibo.it/id/eprint/6245,monograph,,,,,,,amsacta,,,7.13 Rapporto tecnico,perceive project deliverable d63 report with analysis of model behaviour and scenario analysis,multiple ids

La ricerca presentata in questo report è stata supportata dalla Society for the Study of School Psychology (SSSP) e dall’International School Psychology Association (ISPA) allo scopo di rispondere a questo bisogno, indagando i servizi e le attività di tipo psicologico realizzati nelle scuole italiane, approfondendo modalità di erogazione, obiettivi e destinatari coinvolti nelle attività.",technical_report,https://amsacta.unibo.it/id/eprint/6932,monograph,,"Dipartimento di Psicologia “Renzo Canestrari”, Università di Bologna",,,,,amsacta,,,7.13 Rapporto tecnico,la psicologia scolastica in italia,multiple ids

Using system thinking and multi-dimensional analysis, the findings reveal that biodegradable plastics have a high potential to contribute to the sustainability of the agriculture sector. However, many questions remain open and multiple measures must be implemented. Among the priorities, the most compelling are:
1.	To increase farmers’ awareness about the impact of certain practices to the soil and the human health 
2.	To define applications and contexts where conventional mulch films are still a valid option, provided that removal, collection and recycling is ensured  
3.	To invest in R&D to improve the technical characteristics of biodegradable mulch films
4.	To introduce guidelines for better removal of conventional mulch films from soils  
5.	To establish mandatory or voluntary Extended Producer Responsibility schemes in each EU country

Volatile binding media (VBM) are used to protect fragile heritage materials during transport or other high-risk operations. Cyclododecane (CDD) is currently the most used temporary consolidant. Still, this material exhibits some limitations, such as its possible toxicity for humans and the environment, its low flashpoint posing inflammation risks, and the fact that it provides a single sublimation rate, which makes it not suitable for all the climates and applications. The EU-funded VOLATILE4ARCHAEO project investigated alternative VBM, alone and mixed with CDD.

In order to provide effective interventions for food loss and waste (FLW) actions, the project conducts a comprehensive analysis and construction of behavioural intervention model building.
Deliverable 3.1 outlines the conceptual framework for behavioural change understanding in the CHORIZO project. This work aims at setting out the theoretical framework which represents the starting point for the modelling activities, which will focus on the effects of interactions among food supply chain actors and the influence of social norms towards zero food losses and wastes (FLW). The theoretical framework will be here presented by first outlining the complexity underpinning social systems – and food systems more specifically – and the methods available to investigate them Then, the MOA and HUMAT behavioural frameworks will be presented: the former considers food waste as an unintended consequence of iterative decisions, adaptation and behaviours driven both by internal and external factors, the latter explores agents’ behavioural decision mechanisms. The following section will provide an operational definition of social norms. Finally, the last section will supply a set of challenges and attention points to be considered when incorporating MOA and HUMAT into agent-based models and pave the way forward for the understanding of how social norms influence the generation or reduction of food waste.
The document starts with an introduction on the overall project objectives and structure and highlights the framework we propose for understanding and exploring behavioural change in the CHORIZO project. In the following chapters (2 to 6), complex social systems, social norms, and model construct are explained.

I/le partecipanti hanno redatto un testo (di 250-500 parole) su una traccia comune e compilato un questionario sociobiografico di 58 domande (non tutte compaiono nel dataset in quanto alcune non hanno ottenuto un numero statisticamente rilevante di risposte).
