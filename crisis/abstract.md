# Purpose
This study aims to evaluate the representation and dissemination of diverse research outputs - such as software, databases, exhibitions, audio-visual materials, and others - produced by the University of Bologna's (UNIBO) researchers across various repositories. It seeks to assess the extent of overlap among these repositories, analyze citation dynamics involving these research objects, and determine their integration within UNIBO's [Current Research Information System (IRIS)](https://cris.unibo.it/).

# Methodology
The project team has systematically collected and analyzed metadata from selected institutional, disciplinary, and generalist repositories, including [AMS Acta](https://amsacta.unibo.it/), [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/), and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/). Relevant data and metadata were extracted using APIs and web scraping techniques. The analysis identified cross-repository depositions to assess overlaps and employ citation analysis tools, such as [OpenCitations](https://opencitations.net/), to examine citation patterns. Additionally, the collected data were cross-referenced with IRIS to evaluate its coverage of these research outputs.

# Findings
The analysis reveals that the coverage of the diverse research outputs produced by the personnel of the University of Bologna varies significantly across the selected repositories. AMS Acta primarily hosts institutional outputs, while Software Heritage focuses on software-related contributions, and Zenodo encompasses a broader range of interdisciplinary research objects. There is a notable overlap among these repositories with certain identical research objects being deposited across multiple repositories. Citation analysis indicates that while these research objects generate both incoming and outgoing citations, their citation networks are unevenly distributed, with software and databases receiving more frequent references. Moreover, a substantial portion of these research objects remains unmapped in IRIS, highlighting gaps in institutional tracking and integration. These findings emphasize the need for a more cohesive strategy to enhance visibility, discoverability, and interoperability across repositories.

# Value
This study shed light on the dissemination patterns and citation impact of UNIBO's diverse research outputs, providing insights to enhance their visibility and accessibility. The findings can inform strategies to optimize repository usage and improve the integration of these research objects within IRIS, ultimately strengthening open science practices at the University of Bologna and promoting a more cohesive approach for maximizing the impact of its research outputs.
