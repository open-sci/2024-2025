Zenodo:
- The schema used is an adapted version of DataCite metadata schema (https://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.6/).
- API available but with limited functionalities (it's only possible to retrive records through DOI) and API key is required (https://developers.zenodo.org/#rest-api).
- As far as we could gather Zenodo doesn't offer directly dumps of their data but it provides metadata harvesting interface via OAI-PMH, which allows access to all public records in standard formats like Dublin Core and DataCite XML (https://developers.zenodo.org/#changes).
